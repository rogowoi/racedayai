## Production Notes for Tolstoy

When generating on platform.gotolstoy.com:

1. **Avatar style:** Young, athletic-looking presenter. Energetic but not over the top.
2. **Background:** Clean, simple. Gym, outdoors, or plain wall.
3. **Pacing:** Fast — TikTok viewers scroll quickly. No slow intros.
4. **Captions:** Auto-generate captions. Most TikTok is watched on mute.
5. **Hook rule:** The first sentence of every script is the hook. It must create curiosity or say something surprising within 2 seconds.
6. **CTA:** Every video ends with "Link in bio" or "Link below."
7. **Screen recordings:** For Video 5 and any visual overlays, screen-record the wizard at racedayai.com/wizard and the results page. Overlay these during editing.

### Priority order for production
1. Video 5 (Screen Recording) — shows the actual product
2. Video 1 (The Discovery) — broadest appeal
3. Video 2 (The Problem) — strong hook
4. Video 3 (The Comparison) — value anchor
5. Videos 6-8 — specific angles for testing
